* Ubuntu
Based on Debian architecture, can use apt-get package manager, 
updates are more frequent. Much of the software is synced with 
Debian repositories. Has focus on providing solid desktop experience.


* Centos
Forked from RHEL (with all trademarks removed), uses ```yum``` package manager.
More stable than Ubuntu, less frequent updates. Better for business, 
while ubuntu is better for personal use.


* Fedora

sponsored by Red Hat


* Debian
OS composed only of free open-source software, running since 1993. 
Release move slower than for Ubuntu

Commercial linux distribution for servers and workstations. 
Has trademarks


If a stable no-desktop distro is needed:
1. CentOS for servers
2. Debian for software development
