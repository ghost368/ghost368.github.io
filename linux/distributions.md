Current linux distributions mostly descend from either Debian (open source)
or RedHat Enterprise Linux or RHEL (commercial)

- the two families have quite different package managers, package and repository formats and filesystem structures

- Debian inheritants use APT (advanced package tool)

- RHEL has YUM, and its newer version DNF

- RHEL descendants are mostly used as server OS



* **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**
Commercial linux distribution for servers and workstations. Used in production worldwide.


* **Centos**
Forked from RHEL (with all trademarks and non-free packages removed), uses ```yum``` package manager.
More stable than Ubuntu, less frequent updates. Better for business, 
while ubuntu is better for personal use. Centos is mostly used as server OS (just like RHEL)


* **Fedora**
Fedora is Red Hat testing ground, new features are first added to Fedora and if they stand the test of time, they can be later added to RHEL.


---------------------------------


* **Debian**
OS composed only of free open-source software, running since 1993. 
Release move slower than for Ubuntu, serves as a base for Ubuntu.


* **Ubuntu**
Based on Debian architecture, can use apt-get package manager, 
updates are more frequent. Much of the software is synced with 
Debian repositories. Has focus on providing solid desktop experience.
Most popular distro for desktops and personal use.


-------------------------------------

There are lots of other distributions, but they are mostly also derived either from RHEL or Debian
