  * tool to walk over google search results with keyboard:
https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator
install through chrome webstore

(the tools is really cool, it supports vim-like navigation, left/right will switch google search pages !; more shortcuts here https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator)

* BlockSite extension to block websites that I automatically open 
to procrastinate

* history and cache cleaner

* lastpass

* auto accept-cookies

* Open New Tab After Current Tab extension:
  Ctrl+T will open the new table next to current one
  (there are several such extensions, choose one that does not introduce new shortcuts, so that e.g. Ctrl+Y is not used, 
  this is useful when working with jupyterlab)

* Hide download bar extension
then use Ctrl+Shift+H to hide it

* to change scale of the page (e.g. for jupyter notebook) : 
use 'more' (triple circle in the top right) -> zoom

* go to chrome://settings/content/cookies?search=cookies+and+site+data, 
turn on "Clear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome"

* when I connect to Google account, it automatically uploads all my installed extensions, 
as well as settings (delete cookies when I quit, etc)
